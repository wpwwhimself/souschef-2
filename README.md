# Sous-chef: an app for a sclerotic cook

//TODO logo

This is an assistant app for a sclerotic cook such as myself 🧑‍🍳 It manages the state of my kitchen and suggests different meals to cook 🍳 as well as creates a handy shopping list 🛒

This one is an API made in **Laravel** and maintaining a **MySQL** database . [Its sister-project](https://github.com/wpwwhimself/souschef-2) is a mobile app serving as the front-end. Motivation is simple – I often forget what I have in my kitchen and need something that prevents me from buying 5 packs of cheese 🧀

## Features

This app can be called a WMS of sorts. Its goal is to be quick, functional and accessible, and as such, its features include:

- 🗄️ maintaining kitchen stock
- 📷 barcode scanner for quick product identification
- 🗑️ tracking expiry dates and notifications
- 📜 recipes adapted to current stock
